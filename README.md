# Auto Beer Pong
A 12th grade Computer Science project that consists of a game of beer pong that automatically tracks hits, score, special events and multiple teams.

This resembles our final semester project in robotics, which counts as an exam.

## Features
* Tracking hits and displaying hit cups (perhaps by a red LED)
* Being able to manually set cups as hit or not hit
* Remembering the hits of both teams, so only half a set is needed for a full game
* Button for switching the active team
* Special events
  * Two more throws when both balls are hit in the same round
  * Detecting a beer pong bomb and marking cups around the bomb cup as hit
  * Twice a game "arranging" the cups in a better formation (but only if sensible)
